### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt that the topics in the lab decently prepared us to complete the project. I think it was just the complexity, edge cases, and application to a different project that made things feel alot more difficult than it actually would be.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would've finished the stretch features and also added more animations/design for a better UI. I think a personal feature I would like to add is for a user to star or favorite a playlist or song and have that pop up on a favorite page.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Shout out to Matthew for helping me getting the modal to display. It was taking me hours and longer than I expected so I realized that I probably should ask for help more often and sooner.

Another shout out to Noble for always being willing to help me out with features/logic that he had already implemented.
